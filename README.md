    Open Flight Log
</h1>

Open Flight Log is a lightweight, web-based flight logbook and tracker for pilots.
Built with Python and FastAPI, it offers a modern alternative to traditional paper or desktop-based logbooks.


## Objective
This project aims to create a web-accessible digital flight logbook tailored for pilots. 
Unlike most existing solutions, which are closed-source and often limited to local GUI applications, 
this initiative focuses on accessibility, portability, and ease of deployment.

The goal is to provide a free and modern alternative that can be self-hosted 
or deployed with minimal setup using Docker. 
By leveraging FastAPI and SQLite, the system is designed to be lightweight yet extensible, 
making it suitable for both student and professional pilots.

The project is being developed with practical input from an active student pilot, 
ensuring it aligns with real-world needs and usability expectations. 
The ultimate objective is to make flight logging simpler, more accessible, 
and freely available to the aviation community.
